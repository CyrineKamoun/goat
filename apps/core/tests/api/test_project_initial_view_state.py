"""HTTP-level coverage for the `user_project` (initial view state) lazy
fallback introduced when the fan-out share triggers were retired: with no
row for the requester or the project owner (e.g. a project reassigned by
`remove_user`, whose old owner's row was cascade-deleted), the endpoint now
returns the same default a brand-new project gets instead of 404ing on a
project the caller otherwise has access to. Also proves that the deleted
create-time `project_user` insert was redundant — ownership resolves from
`Project.user_id` alone."""
