-- Storage accounting for an organization, maintained from its layers.
--
-- SECURITY DEFINER on purpose: the function is owned by the application role,
-- which may write `customer.organization`, while callers that hold only a
-- narrow grant on `customer.layer` may not. The thumbnail task is the case
-- that forced this — it connects as the read-only role, holds a column grant
-- on `layer.thumbnail_url`, and every write it made aborted with
-- "permission denied for table organization" raised by this trigger. Book-
-- keeping a row the caller cannot see is the definer's job, not the caller's.
--
-- The pinned `search_path` deliberately does NOT name the data schema:
-- init_triggers.py rewrites the literal `customer.` in this file to the
-- configured schema and would not reach a bare word here, leaving a stale
-- name behind on any deployment that renames it. Every reference in the body
-- is qualified, so the path does not need it.
