    set, pydantic-settings supplies the field under its alias, and a
    `CatalogSettings(field=...)` kwarg arrives under the field name as well —
    a second key for an already-populated field, which the model rejects as an
    extra input. Tests construct settings that way throughout, so a developer
    whose environment defines those vars would see the suite fail on
    configuration rather than on behaviour.

    The names come from the model, so a field added later is covered without
