# Operations

This page covers the everyday tasks of running GOAT with Docker Compose: managing users, loading the routing base data, backups, upgrades and troubleshooting. Run all commands from the bundle folder.

## Users and the Keycloak admin console {#users}

User accounts live in Keycloak; organizations, teams and roles live in GOAT.

The Keycloak admin console is at `<GOAT URL>/keycloak/admin`. Sign in with the user `admin` and the password `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env`. GOAT's users are in the realm `goat` (`REALM_NAME`).

To add a user, invite them in GOAT: open <code>Settings</code> → <code>Organization</code> → <code>Members</code>, click <code>New Member</code>, enter the email address, choose the role and click <code>Send Invite</code>.

Self-registration is switched off in the bundled realm, so GOAT creates the login account for an address that does not have one yet:

- **With [email](./external_services.md#email) set up**, the invited person receives two emails: GOAT's invitation and a message from Keycloak with a link to set their password. After setting it they sign in, GOAT shows the invitation, and they click <code>Accept</code> to join the organization.
- **Without email**, the account is created but nobody is told. GOAT shows a warning after the invitation; set a password for the new user in the Keycloak admin console (realm `goat`, *Users*) and pass it on. On their first sign-in Keycloak asks them to choose their own.

Accounts can also be created directly in the admin console; the invitation then only adds the person to the organization. With your own Keycloak, GOAT creates the accounts there as well, provided its service account may manage users; set `KEYCLOAK_PROVISION_INVITED_USERS=false` to turn this off.

:::tip Restrict the admin console
List the networks that may open `/keycloak/admin` in `GOAT_ADMIN_ALLOW_CIDRS`, for example your office network. Requests from other addresses get `403`. The default allows every address.

```bash
GOAT_ADMIN_ALLOW_CIDRS=192.168.10.0/24 10.20.0.0/16
```
:::

## Windmill, the job engine {#windmill}

Windmill runs the analysis tools, dataset imports, PDF printing and scheduled tasks. Its interface is not published; it listens on `127.0.0.1` of the server only. Reach it through an SSH tunnel:

```bash
ssh -L 8110:127.0.0.1:8110 <server>
```

Then open `http://localhost:8110` and sign in as `admin@windmill.dev` with the password `WINDMILL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from `.env`. The port is set by `WINDMILL_LOCAL_PORT`.

**Parallel analyses:** `GOAT_TOOLS_WORKERS` (default `2`) sets how many analysis jobs run at the same time. Each tools worker may use up to 4 GB of RAM, so size it to your server.

## Routing base data {#base-data}

Catchment areas, heatmaps and the public transport tools need a **street network** and **public transport data**. They are not downloaded automatically: the full set is tens of GB, so you choose the region you work in with a bounding box (`min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat`).

```bash
# Show what would be fetched, and how much
./base-data.sh --dry-run --bbox 11.3,48.0,11.8,48.3

# Download
./base-data.sh --bbox 11.3,48.0,11.8,48.3

# Download, and repeat this download every week
./base-data.sh --bbox 11.3,48.0,11.8,48.3 --weekly on
```

The download runs as a job in the running GOAT stack; `base-data.sh` follows it and prints its log until it finishes.

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--bbox min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat` | Fetch only the area around this box. The street network is split into regional tiles; GOAT fetches the tiles covering the box plus a ring of neighbouring tiles. The public transport timetable is always fetched in full. |
| `--datasets a,b` | The data sets to fetch, separated by commas. Default: `street_network,public_transport`. Also available: `traveltime_matrices` (only for the legacy heatmaps), `nuts` and `geoip`. |
| `--dry-run` | Report what would be fetched, without writing anything |
| `--weekly on\|off` | Also repeat this run (with the same region and data sets) every week, on Tuesdays at 03:00 UTC, or stop repeating it |

The data comes from `GOAT_BASE_DATA_URL`, by default Plan4Better's public base data server. If your server has no access to it, point the setting at an internal mirror.

## Backups {#backups}

### Switch on nightly backups {#backup-setup}

Add `backup` to `COMPOSE_PROFILES` in `.env`, for example `COMPOSE_PROFILES=garage,keycloak,backup`, and run `docker compose up -d`.

Every night at `BACKUP_TIME` (UTC, default `02:30`), the backup service writes to `./backups/<timestamp>`:

- a dump of each database: `goat`, `keycloak` and `windmill`;
- an archive of GOAT's data volume (layer data, tiles, base data);
- with the bundled Garage, an archive of the object storage.

Backups older than `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` (default `7`) are removed.

To make a backup right away:

```bash
docker compose run --rm backup --now
```

:::warning Copy backups off the server
Backups in `./backups` are on the same disk as GOAT. Copy the folder to another place with your usual tooling, for example `rclone` or `restic`. Keep a copy of `.env` with them: the restored databases and storage expect the passwords and keys it holds.
:::

If you use your own S3 storage, the files in it are not part of these backups; back them up with your storage provider's means.

### Restore a backup {#restore}

```bash
./restore.sh backups/<timestamp>
```

`restore.sh` asks you to type `restore` to confirm. It then stops GOAT, replaces **all current data** with the backup (databases and volumes), and starts GOAT again. Check the result with `./smoke.sh --quick`.

The same works on a new server: install the bundle of the same version, put the `.env` from your backup into its folder, and run `restore.sh` with the path to the backup folder.

The full cycle of backup, complete wipe and restore has been tested.

## Upgrades {#upgrade}

1. Make a backup: `docker compose run --rm backup --now` (see [Backups](#backups)).
2. Download `goat-compose-<version>.tar.gz` of the new release and unpack it over your installation. Your `.env`, `certs/` and `backups/` are not part of the archive and stay as they are.
3. Run:

   ```bash
   tar xzf goat-compose-<version>.tar.gz --strip-components=1
   ./setup.sh             # switches GOAT_VERSION to the new release, adds new settings, keeps the rest
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d   # database migrations run automatically
   ./smoke.sh --quick
   ```

## Logs {#logs}

```bash
docker compose logs -f <service>    # e.g. core, web, geoapi, processes, keycloak, caddy
docker compose logs --tail 100 windmill-worker-tools
```

The logs of every service rotate automatically.

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

**Start with `./smoke.sh`.** It names the failing step and prints the logs of the service involved.

**Check the containers** with `docker compose ps -a`:

- Every one-time service (the names ending in `-init`, `-migrate`, `-bootstrap` and `-sync`) should show `Exited (0)`.
- Every other service should show `healthy` or `running`.

A one-time service with another exit code shows why in its logs, e.g. `docker compose logs core-migrate`.

**Let's Encrypt fails** (`auto` mode): check that port 443 reaches the server from the internet and that the DNS name resolves to it. Then look at `docker compose logs caddy`. See also [Automatic certificate](./https.md#auto).

**Catchment areas, heatmaps or public transport analyses fail:** the [routing base data](#base-data) for the area is probably missing.

**Emails do not arrive:** check the [email settings](./external_services.md#email) and the log of the last email attempt: `docker compose logs core` for GOAT's emails, `docker compose logs keycloak` for password emails. A certificate error there (`CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED`, `PKIX path building failed`) means the relay's certificate comes from a CA that GOAT does not trust yet; see [Company CA](./https.md#company-ca).
