# HTTPS and addresses

GOAT is reachable under **one public URL**, and Caddy, the proxy in front of all services, decides how HTTPS works. You choose the URL and the TLS mode with `setup.sh`, interactively or with options:

```bash
./setup.sh --public-url <url> --tls <mode>
docker compose up -d
```

The public URL must be a bare origin without a path, for example `https://goat.example.org`, `http://10.0.0.5` or `http://10.0.0.5:8080`. All services live under it (see [Where the services live](./installation.md#urls)).

## The four TLS modes {#modes}

| Mode | Use it when | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| `auto` | The server has a public DNS name | Caddy gets a certificate from Let's Encrypt and renews it |
| `custom` | You have your own certificate | Caddy uses `cert.pem` and `key.pem` from `./certs` |
| `internal` | Test installations in an intranet | Caddy issues a certificate from its own CA; browsers warn until that CA is trusted |
| `off` | Local installations over plain HTTP, or behind your own load balancer that handles TLS | No TLS in Caddy |

All four modes have been tested, including `off` behind a load balancer.

## Automatic certificate (`auto`) {#auto}

```bash
./setup.sh --public-url https://goat.example.org --tls auto --acme-email ops@<your-domain>
```

Requirements:

- The DNS name resolves to the server.
- Ports **80 and 443** reach the server from the internet, because Let's Encrypt validates the domain through them.
- The URL has no port.

Caddy then gets the certificate on the first start, renews it on its own and redirects HTTP to HTTPS.

The email for Let's Encrypt (`--acme-email`, stored as `GOAT_ACME_EMAIL`) is optional; Let's Encrypt uses it for expiry notices. Let's Encrypt rejects contacts on domains outside the public DNS, and your site would then get no certificate. `setup.sh` therefore refuses addresses ending in `.test`, `.local`, `.localhost`, `.invalid` or `.example`, and addresses at `example.com`, `example.org`, `example.net` or `localhost`. Use a real address or leave the field empty.

:::tip Certificate not issued?
Check that ports 80 and 443 reach the server and that the DNS name resolves to it, then look at `docker compose logs caddy`.
:::

## Your own certificate (`custom`) {#custom}

Put two PEM files into the `certs` folder of the bundle:

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `certs/cert.pem` | The certificate with its full chain (your certificate first, then the intermediate certificates) |
| `certs/key.pem` | The private key |

```bash
./setup.sh --public-url https://goat.example.org --tls custom
docker compose up -d
```

`setup.sh` reminds you if the files are missing. In this mode the URL may contain a port other than 443, such as `https://goat.example.org:8443`; Caddy then serves HTTPS on that port.

## Caddy's own CA (`internal`) {#internal}

For test installations in an intranet, Caddy can issue a certificate from its own certificate authority. Browsers show a warning until you trust that CA's root certificate. Copy it out of the proxy container:

```bash
docker compose cp caddy:/data/caddy/pki/authorities/local/root.crt .
```

Then import `root.crt` into the trust store of your operating system or browser.

`setup.sh` points `GOAT_CA_BUNDLE` at this root certificate, so that GOAT's own services, such as the web server and the PDF print worker, trust the address too. `smoke.sh` skips certificate verification in this mode.

## Plain HTTP (`off`) {#off}

For local installations without TLS:

```bash
./setup.sh --public-url http://10.0.0.5 --tls off
```

With a port in the URL, such as `http://10.0.0.5:8080`, Caddy listens on that port instead of port 80. For an `http://` URL, the login server accepts logins over plain HTTP from any address.

:::warning
Without TLS, passwords and data travel unencrypted. Use plain HTTP only in networks you trust.
:::

## Behind your own load balancer {#load-balancer}

If a load balancer or reverse proxy of yours terminates TLS, keep the `https://` URL and switch TLS in Caddy off. Choose the port on which Caddy should accept plain HTTP from the load balancer:

```bash
./setup.sh --public-url https://goat.example.org --tls off --http-port 8080
docker compose up -d
```

Then:

1. Point your load balancer at port `8080` of the server.
2. List the load balancer's addresses in `GOAT_TRUSTED_PROXIES` in `.env`, as CIDRs separated by spaces. Caddy honours the `X-Forwarded-*` headers only from these addresses. The default, `private_ranges`, covers the RFC 1918 networks.
3. Make sure the server itself can reach the public URL through the load balancer: GOAT's containers call it, for example during login and PDF printing.

In this mode Caddy does not publish port 443 on the server, so the port stays free for other software.

## Company CA {#company-ca}

If certificates in your network come from a private certificate authority, for example the certificate of your load balancer or of your own Keycloak, GOAT has to trust that CA. Put the CA certificate (PEM) into `./certs` and set its path inside the containers in `.env`:

```bash
GOAT_CA_BUNDLE=/certs/company-ca.pem
```

Apply the change with `docker compose up -d`. GOAT's web server and the job workers, including the PDF print worker, then trust the CA. `GOAT_CA_BUNDLE` holds one file; in `internal` mode `setup.sh` uses it for Caddy's root certificate.

## HSTS and security headers {#hsts}

In the modes `auto`, `custom` and `internal`, Caddy sends the header `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000`. Browsers that have visited GOAT then insist on HTTPS for this host name for one year. Keep this in mind before you move a host name from HTTPS back to plain HTTP.

In `off` mode Caddy sends no HSTS header. Behind your own load balancer, set HSTS there if you want it.

In every mode Caddy also sends `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`, and removes the `Server` header.

## Changing the address later {#change-url}

Run `setup.sh` again with the new URL or mode, then `docker compose up -d`. `setup.sh` rewrites all values it derives from the URL and the TLS mode.

:::info
The bundled Keycloak follows the new URL on its own: on every `docker compose up -d`, the step `keycloak-sync` sets the GOAT client's addresses (root URL, redirect URIs, web origins) and the HTTPS requirement from `.env`. With your own Keycloak, update the client there.
